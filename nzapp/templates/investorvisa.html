                    <h3>Types of Investor Visa</h3>
                    <ul> There are two types of visas that allow you to invest in the country,  which will also grant you residence:
                      <li class="font-italic"> <i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> Investor 1 resident visa: If you invest 10 million NZD (6,5 million  USD) in the country over the course of three years, you and your  family can live in New Zealand indefinitely.</li>
                      <li class="font-italic"> <i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> Investor 2 resident visa: If you are under 65 years of age and  you invest 3 million NZD (2 million USD) over the course of four  years, you and your family can live in New Zealand indefinitely.  However, there is a quota of 400 people for this type of visa.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                    <h3>Residency Permits: Temporary and Permanent</h3>
                  <p>In general, all visas in New Zealand are temporary and automatically  grant you residence for its duration. If you want to become a permanent  resident in New Zealand, you will first have to apply for a temporary  residence permit and only later, apply for permanent residence in New  Zealand. Beware, that only some visas allow you to bring  your spouse and immediate family with you. New Zealand does not have  a fiance visa in its migration law.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>However, not all temporary visas can lead to residence—there are  specific visa types that can be extended and eventually lead to  residence. These types of visas are explained below, as well as all the  necessary temporary residence permit requirements, steps, benefits,  and fees.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Typically, to become a permanent resident you must be 55 or  younger and have worked in New Zealand for two years on a  temporary visa.</p>
